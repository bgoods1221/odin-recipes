   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>
    This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce 
    and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made 
    with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
    I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.

   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1/2 pound pork</li>
    <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook 
        and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, 
        about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, 
        oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, 
        for 30 minutes. </li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna 
        noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 
        minutes. Drain and set aside. </li>
    <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. 
        Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes. </li>
    <li> Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving. </li>
   </ol>
